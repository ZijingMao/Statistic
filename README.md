Bayesian Hierarchical Model for Beer Scoring:
In this model, we build a hierarchical Bayesian model use Normal distribution as our base model assumption.
Assume variance is known and provided by sample variance, mean following a prior normal distribution ~N(mu,tau)
mu and tau are two parameters with join prior distribution as non-informative prior.

Based on this Hierarchical model we select the best beer type: Blue Moon
